    # Time-Series-Forecasting

    ## What is Time Series?
Making scientific projections based on data with historical time stamps is known as time series forecasting. It entails creating models through historical study and using them to draw conclusions and guide strategic decision-making in the future.
The fact that the future result is wholly unknown at the time of the task and can only be anticipated after thorough analysis and evidence-based priors is an essential distinction in forecasting.
